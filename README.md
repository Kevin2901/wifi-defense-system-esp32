#  Wireless Network Defense System (ESP32)

##  Overview
This project is a **hardware-based Wi-Fi protection system** using the **ESP32 microcontroller**.  
It can detect **de-authentication attacks**, perform **anomaly detection**, and **monitor suspicious IP activity** in real time.  

Unlike software-only solutions, it provides a **hardware-software hybrid approach** that is **affordable, scalable, and resilient**, even in resource-limited environments.

##  Features
-  Real-time detection of de-authentication attacks  
-  Anomaly detection based on traffic patterns  
-  Promiscuous packet capture for Wi-Fi monitoring  
-  Alert system for administrators  
-  Scalable, affordable, and lightweight solution
