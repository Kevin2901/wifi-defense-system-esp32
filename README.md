# 🔐 Wireless Network Defense System (ESP32)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **hardware-based Wi-Fi protection system** using the **ESP32 microcontroller**.  
It can detect **de-authentication attacks**, perform **anomaly detection**, and **monitor suspicious IP activity** in real time.  

Unlike software-only solutions, it provides a **hardware-software hybrid approach** that is **affordable, scalable, and resilient**, even in resource-limited environments.
